# Waystone Instructions üìÉ

> [!WARNING]  
> Make sure you have the latest versions of:
> - **Skript**
> - **SkBee**
> - **Skript-GUI**
> - **Skript-Particle**
> - **SkJson**

> This guide will help you set up the [Waystone](Global.Waystone.sk). The term ‚ÄúWaystone‚Äù ensures compatibility with other plugins that use `/waypoint`.

1. Install both [Waystone](Global.Waystone.sk) and [LocationEventWaystone](Global.LocationEventWaystone).
2. Adjust the options in the files as desired.
3. Add waypoints to the [Waypoints YAML](../waypoints.yml) file in the following format:
    ```yaml
    unique-id-of-the-waypoint:
        world: world
        x: x
        y: y
        z: z
        name: Unique name for the waypoint (used to sort locations in the script)
        desc: Description
        displayname: Display name for the player (supports MiniMessage)
        icon: Base64 value of the skull texture
    ```
4. **Reload** the script.
5. To use a waypoint in-game, place a purple stained glass block one block below the defined location. This marks the location, triggering the waypoint function when players step on it.\
   For safety, place a beacon under the purple stained glass to avoid accidental waypoint placements. Although the script checks if players are at a waypoint, this original setup method is recommended.
